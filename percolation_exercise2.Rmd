## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
df <- read.csv("D:/GEOG 808/Ex_2.csv")
glimpse(df)
summary(df)
colnames(df[2])
class(df)
View(df)

# rename the columns
df <- setNames(df, c("Density_percent","Percent_burned"))
colnames(df)
View(df)

df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Density_percent, y = Percent_burned)) +
    geom_point(colour="#000099") + geom_line(colour="#000099")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
